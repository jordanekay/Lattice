Lattice maps http:// and https:// URLs to custom native app URL schemes based on the host and path.

Usage
-----
Lattice is a work in progress, and there remains the possibility that certain edge-case URLs may not open properly. At some point I will host stable versions of the app and extension in the Downloads section. Assuming this risk, if you would like to build the latest master from source, use the following steps:

1. Clone the repository and build and launch Lattice.app.
2. In Safari, with the Develop menu enabled, choose “Show Extension Builder” and add Lattice.safariextension, then click “Install.” You will need a Safari Developer Certificate.
